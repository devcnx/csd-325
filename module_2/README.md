This repository contains the source code, flowchart, and debugging documentation for the Module 2.2 assignment. This
is meant to demonstrate proficiency in program flow and practical debugging techniques in Python.

## Assignment Overview

#### Steps

- Select a Python program with at least one function (from previous coursework or research).
- Create a flowchart modeling the program's logic using a drawing application.
- Copy and paste the flowchart into a Word document and save it in this module.
- Review the Debugging Guide and/or the Python debugging tutorial by Abiola (codementor.io, 2017).
- Use the IDF to debug the program:
  - Set a breaking point and start debugging.
  - Take screenshots showing:
    - The breakpoint hit.
    - Stepping into the function.
    - Additional debugging actions or error handling.
- Paste screenshots into a Word document with captions explaining each step and save.
- Commit and push all files to GitHub.

### Assignment Deliverables

- Flowchart
- Debugging Documentation
- Program Source Code
- The Below Results Document (Word or PDF)

#### Results Document (Word or PDF)

- All code pasted directly into the document. - Include the **filename** at the top of each code block in the document. - Ensure proper formatting and indentation.
  - Screenshot(s) of the programming running successfully.
    - Must show **visible current timestamp** (e.g., system time/date in the corner).
      - **Full-screen** screenshots are preferred.
  - Screenshot(s) demonstrating 100% test coverage.
    - Run the program with **multiple inputs**, if necessary.
    - Make sure all input and output are clearly visible.
