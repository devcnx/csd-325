# Module

This repository contains the source code for an assignment in the CSD325 course. The assignment is designed to demonstrate proficiency in advanced Python programming.

## Assignment Overview

#### Steps

<!-- For this assignment, you have two tasks. The first is to create a flowchart (or flowcharts) for the following requirements, then to write a Python program that produces the required results:

Create (if you haven't already) a directory in CSD-325 named module-8.
Open up a drawing application. Use a text element to include your name and assignment number at the top of the drawing. Create a flowchart that models the program below. Either copy/paste the diagram into a Word document or save as a .pdf. File should be saved to your module-8 directory.
Open a Word document and put your name and assignment number at the top.
Read through Reading List above.
Download the student.json file attached to the assignment. Take a look at the contents.
Create a program that includes the following:
Use the JSON load()  function to load the file into a Python class list.
Create a function that loops through the .json class list and prints out each value, should look something like:
Ripley, Ellen : ID = 45604 , Email = eripley@gmail.com
Output notification to the user that this is the original Student list.
Call your print function.
Add your last name, first name, fictional ID, and email to the class list using append().
Output notification to the user that this is the updated Student list.
Call your print function.
Use the JSON dump() function to append the new data to the .json file.
Output notification to the user that the .json file was updated.
Run the program and take a screenshot of the results. Paste that screenshot into your Word document.
Once the program runs, you should also see a notification that the student.json file has changed, with a choice to save or not. Take a screen shot of the notification and paste into your Word document. Should look similar to :
Decorative

Open the .json file and copy the contents, then paste that into your Word document.
Save your Word document to your module-8 directory.
Save the Python file(s) to your module-8 directory -->

- This assignment has two tasks.

### Assignment Deliverables

- [ Each step required deliverable, as listed below or otherwise mentioned, from the assignment instructions. ]

#### Results Document (Word or PDF)

- All code pasted directly into the document. - Include the **filename** at the top of each code block in the document. - Ensure proper formatting and indentation.
  - Screenshot(s) of the programming running successfully.
    - Must show **visible current timestamp** (e.g., system time/date in the corner).
      - **Full-screen** screenshots are preferred.
  - Screenshot(s) demonstrating 100% test coverage.
    - Run the program with **multiple inputs**, if necessary.
    - Make sure all input and output are clearly visible.
