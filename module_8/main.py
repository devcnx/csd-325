Assignment: Module 8.2 JSON Practice
Purpose: Demonstrate ability to work with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

The purpose of this program is to use an existing JSON file to create a list
of students, add a new student to the list, and then write the updated list
back to the JSON file.

This module is the driver for the JSON student management system.
"""

# Create a function that loops through the .json class list and prints out each value.
# The format should be Last Name, First Name : ID = #, Email = email


# Output notification to the user that this is the original Student list.


# Call the function to print the original Student list.


# Add your last name, first name, fictional ID, and email to the class
# list using append().


# Output notification to the user that this is the updated Student list.


# Call the function to print the updated Student list.


# Use the json.dump() function to append the new data to the .json file.


# Output notification to the user that the .json file was updated.


# Run the program and take a screenshot of the results.


# Once the program runs, you should also see a notification that the student.json
# file has changed, with a choice to save or not.
# This should be a pop-up dialog box that appears after the program runs.
# It should have the path to the json file, and a message to the user asking if
# they want to save the changes.
# If they decide not to save, the file should revert back to its original state.
# If they decide to save, the file should be saved to the same location.
