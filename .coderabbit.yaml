  - path: "**/*.py"
    instructions: |
      Please act as a Python programming mentor for the CSD325 course.
      - Ensure the code adheres to PEP 8 standards for style and readability.
      - Check for clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions, explaining their purpose, arguments, and what they return.
      - Point out any unhandled exceptions or potential runtime errors.
      - Suggest more "Pythonic" ways to write code where applicable (e.g., using comprehensions, context managers).

  - path: "**/test_*.py"
    instructions: |
      This is a `pytest` test file. Please review it carefully.
      - Ensure that test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_city_country_population`).
      - Confirm that appropriate pytest assertions are used (e.g., `assert x == y`, `assert value is True`).
      - Check that the tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
      - Ensure the file correctly imports the functions/classes being tested.

  - path: "**/views.py"
    instructions: |
      This is a Django views file.
      - Ensure it imports `HttpResponse` from `django.http`.
      - Check that each view function accepts a `request` object as its first parameter.
      - Verify that each view returns an `HttpResponse` object.

  - path: "**/*high_low*.py"
    instructions: |
      This is a data visualization script using Matplotlib and the CSV module.
      - Check that any opened CSV files are properly closed, preferably using a `with` statement.
      - Ensure that all plots generated with Matplotlib have a title, an x-axis label, and a y-axis label for clarity.
      - Verify that different data series (e.g., highs vs. lows) are plotted in different colors to be easily distinguishable.
