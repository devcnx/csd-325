This repository contains the source code for an assignment in the CSD325 course. The assignment is designed to demonstrate proficiency in advanced Python programming.

## Assignment Overview

#### Steps

- Make the following modifications to the program:
  - [ ] Add a lake roughly in the center of the display.
    - **Note**: Look at the video, "Mod5 Cartesian", for a brief explanation of how elements are placed in a display.
  - [ ] The water feature should use a different character (not A or @) and be blue.
  - [ ] The water feature cannot be modified once it is in place, the water feature acts as a firebreak that flames cannot cross.

### Assignment Deliverables

- [ ] The modified program.
- [ ] A revised flowchart.

### Results Document (Word or PDF)

- All code pasted directly into the document. - Include the **filename** at the top of each code block in the document. - Ensure proper formatting and indentation.
  - Screenshot(s) of the programming running successfully.
    - Must show **visible current timestamp** (e.g., system time/date in the corner).
      - **Full-screen** screenshots are preferred.
  - Screenshot(s) demonstrating 100% test coverage.
    - Run the program with **multiple inputs**, if necessary.
    - Make sure all input and output are clearly visible.
