Assignment: Module 6.2 Forest Fire Simulation: Program and Revised Flowchart
Purpose: A program that simulates a forest fire.

This module contains the modified version of `forestfiresim.py` from Module 5.2.
The main difference is that it now includes a lake in the center of the display.
The lake cannot be modified once it is placed. The lake acts as a firebreak that flames
cannot cross.

Modifications include:
    - Adding a lake roughly in the center of the display.
    - The water feature should use a different character (not A or @) and be blue.
    - The water feature cannot be modified once it is in place.
        - It acts as a firebreak that flames cannot cross.
