# GitHub Copilot Universal Repository Instructions

- Follow each language's official style guide and best practices (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Effective Go, Google Java Style, etc.).
- Write clear, readable, and maintainable code; prioritize clarity over brevity or cleverness.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and files, appropriate to the language and project conventions.
- Break down complex logic into well-defined, reusable functions, methods, or classes.
- Write concise docstrings/comments for modules, classes, functions, and non-obvious code sections.
- Avoid the use of deprecated or insecure libraries and APIs.
- Where appropriate, include input validation and error handling.
- For code examples, favor cross-platform and portable approaches unless otherwise specified.
- When applicable, include or suggest automated tests using the standard testing framework for the language (e.g., unittest/pytest for Python, JUnit for Java, Jest for JavaScript).
- For configuration, use environment variables or configuration files, not hard-coded sensitive values.
- Prefer using open-source and well-maintained libraries and tools.
- When generating documentation, use clear, plain Markdown with appropriate code formatting.
- For shell or CLI commands, use POSIX-compliant syntax for maximum portability (unless the repository is platform-specific).
- In code reviews, highlight code quality issues, security concerns, and possible improvements, and provide actionable feedback.
- When in doubt, provide links to relevant documentation or standards.

# Additional Context
