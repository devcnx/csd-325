# Module 9.2 APIs

This repository contains the source code for an assignment in the CSD325 course. The assignment is designed to demonstrate proficiency in advanced Python programming.

## Assignment Overview

#### Steps

- [ ] Create a directory named `module_9`.
- [ ] Open a Word document and put your name and assignment number at the top.
- [ ] Open the API tutorial in the Reading List.
- [ ] Create a Python program to use for the tutorial.
  - Use the correct URL above in the Reading List to test the connection, run the program, take a screenshot of the results and paste into the Word document.
  - Complete the section in the tutorial for retrieving current astronauts and formatting output.
  - Incorporate that code into your program, run the program and take a screenshot of the results and paste into the Word document.
- [ ] Create a program that includes the following:
  - Find a simple API. The link above has a couple that you can work with, but the examples are not in Python...the concept is the same..
  - Test the connection to your API, output results.
  - Print out the response from the request, with no formatting.
  - Print out the response with same formatting as the tutorial program.
  - Run the program and take a screenshot of the results. Paste that screenshot into your Word document.
- [ ] Save your Word document to your `module_9` directory.
- [ ] Save the Python file(s) to your `module_9` directory.

### Assignment Deliverables

- [ ] Word document
- [ ] Python file(s)

#### Results Document (Word or PDF)

- All code pasted directly into the document. - Include the **filename** at the top of each code block in the document. - Ensure proper formatting and indentation.
  - Screenshot(s) of the programming running successfully.
    - Must show **visible current timestamp** (e.g., system time/date in the corner).
      - **Full-screen** screenshots are preferred.
  - Screenshot(s) demonstrating 100% test coverage.
    - Run the program with **multiple inputs**, if necessary.
    - Make sure all input and output are clearly visible.
